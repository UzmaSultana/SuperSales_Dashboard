# SuperSales_Dashboard

This project showcases a cleaned and analyzed sales dataset, visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The data was preprocessed to remove duplicates, fix missing values, and standardize fields for accurate analysis. The dashboard highlights key insights such as sales by region, segment, category, and shipping mode.
Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data.
* Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers.
* Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations.
* Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc).
  
This helps stakeholders to make informed business decisions.
